## Problem Highlight: Roman to Integer (#13)

**Description:**

Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer using Java.
Implements a simple traversal with conditional subtraction logic.

### Features 
- Uses 'HashMap<Character, Integer>' for constant-time lookups
- Handles subtractive notation (e.g., IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM)
- Efficient single-pass O(n) algorithm

### How to run
1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Compile the file:
  '''bash
  javac RomanToInteger.java

### What I learned
- Reinforced understanding of string traversal and index handling
- Learned to use **HashMap** effectively for character-to-integer mapping
- Practiced algorithmic problem-solving and runtime analysis

### Technologies
- **Java**
- **HashMap, String Traversal**, and basic algorithmic logic.
